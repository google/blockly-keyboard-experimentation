# Blockly Keyboard Experimentation

This plugin for Blockly enables keyboard navigation. It is intended to
experiment with different actions that might help visually impaired and motor
impaired people navigate a Blockly workspace.

You can explore the current state of the plugin on the [test page](https://google.github.io/blockly-keyboard-experimentation/).

There is also an [existing keyboard navigation plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockly/keyboard-navigation). That plugin may be where
a finalized version of keyboard navigation eventually lives. But for now, this
is where experimentation will be done.
